## Description

64 is too much, but 32 isn't. 32+32=64?

[32_1.txt](https://nbctf.com/uploads?key=8ed8735f9353cb641c0a0a366bde73b3e952b87e52d91ca350f6224e32d9ecd8%2F32_1.txt), [32_2.txt](https://nbctf.com/uploads?key=f2173aea8271f66a7e590af9dfbd9b9763580ad50f0908ea545abf0ae1a6acba%2F32_2.txt)

## Solution

We are given 2 files which seems to contain Base64 encoded data, after decoding we still get Base64. File needs to be Base64 decoded 32 times (hence the name).

```py
from base64 import b64decode as bd

with open('./32_1.txt') as f: data1 = f.read().strip()
with open('./32_2.txt') as f: data2 = f.read().strip()

for i in range(32):
    data1 = bd(data1).decode()
    data2 = bd(data2).decode()

print(f"{data1}{data2}")
```
