## Solution 

```bash
└─$ la
Permissions Size User Date Modified Name
.rwxrwx---   42M kali  5 Aug 22:39   hello.jpg
```

Image file is awfully huge, so first I tried `binwalk`

```bash
└─$ binwalk --dd='.*' ./hello.jpg

`secrett.zip` requires a password, so let's open `morse.wav`.

We can decode `morse` using <https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html>

> THE PASSWORD IS THE HOVERCRAFT OF MORPHEUS
{: .prompt-info } 

_The hovercraft is a vehicle that Morpheus uses to travel between the Matrix and the real world._<br>
_The hovercraft of Morpheus is called the Nebuchadnezzar. It is a heavily modified Sikorsky S-92A chopper that is used by Morpheus and his crew to travel between the Matrix and the real world. The Nebuchadnezzar is equipped with a variety of weapons and sensors, and it is also capable of underwater travel._<br>
_The name Nebuchadnezzar is a reference to the king of Babylon who was known for his wisdom and power. The name is fitting for the hovercraft, as it is a powerful and versatile vehicle that is used by Morpheus to carry out his mission to free humanity from the Matrix._

Ok, enough backstory. The password should be `nebuchadnezzar`

```bash
└─$ 7z x ./secrett.zip                  
... 
Enter password (will not be echoed): # Enter password
Everything is Ok      
...

Hmm... Pretty good beats for a challenge, but no secret message, no spectogram... `deep_secret`... [Deep Sound](https://wiki.bi0s.in/steganography/deep-sound/)?
