# Inside Encryptodera

## Before Reading

This writeup doesn't contain detailed explanation of everything and assumes you're already familiar with KQL. My assumption is that you completed [Balloons Over Iowa](https://kc7cyber.com/modules/BALLOONS) module, also answer queries are very self-explanatory. <br>
If you are looking for beginner friendly detailed writeup look into the post by [Shinigami42](https://medium.com/@Shinigami42): [KC7: Reflections on “Encryptodera” and Using It to Create a Professional Portfolio](https://medium.com/@Shinigami42/kc7-reflections-on-encryptodera-and-using-it-to-create-a-professional-portfolio-b833eae817a6)

## 2: Crypto Conquest

### **Question 1**: What is the filename of this note?

From the image: _**YOU_GOT_CRYTOED_SO_GIMME_CRYPTO.txt**_

### **Question 2**: What kind of attack is this?

_**[Ransomware](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/ransomware/)** is a type of malware attack in which the attacker locks and encrypts the victim’s data, important files and then demands a payment to unlock and decrypt the data._

### **Question 3**: On how many machines was this .txt file seen?

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'YOU_GOT_CRYTOED_SO_GIMME_CRYPTO.txt'
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

### **Question 4**: What time was the ransom note first seen?

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'YOU_GOT_CRYTOED_SO_GIMME_CRYPTO.txt'
| project timestamp
// | order by timestamp asc // Already Sorted
| take 1
```

### **Question 5**: What is the hostname of the system where the ransom note was first seen?

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'YOU_GOT_CRYTOED_SO_GIMME_CRYPTO.txt'
| project hostname
| take 1
```

### **Question 6**: How many files were encrypted on this machine?

First manually enumerate for anomalies in filenames and then narrow down:

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where hostname == 'UL8R-MACHINE'
```

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where hostname == 'UL8R-MACHINE'
| where filename has '.umadbro'
| count 
```

### **Question 7**: What is the extension that was used on the encrypted files?

We learned it from previous answer, Question 6.

### **Question 8**: What command was run that references the ransomware extension?

```sql
ProcessEvents

| where process_commandline has 'umadbro'
| project process_commandline
```

### **Question 9**: When did files_go_byebye.exe appear on this machine?

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where hostname == 'UL8R-MACHINE'
| where filename == 'files_go_byebye.exe'
| project timestamp
```

### **Question 10**: How many commands were run on UL8R-MACHINE during this timeframe?

Query given:

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == "UL8R-MACHINE"
| where timestamp between (datetime("2024-02-16") .. datetime("2024-02-18"))
```

Answer: 

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == "UL8R-MACHINE"
| where timestamp between (datetime("2024-02-16") .. datetime("2024-02-18"))
| count 
```

### **Question 11**: What domain does the encoded PowerShell reference?

```sql

```

### **Question 12**: What command is run right before the base64-encoded PowerShell?

Narrow down search with `process_hash` of malicious pwsh command and **[rows_near](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/rows-near-plugin)** for ease of finding nearby rows.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == "UL8R-MACHINE"
| serialize 
| evaluate rows_near(process_hash == '6716595f0a4eeea7c0b4a34312356494c65653cfe6b4776d078bd599ca328842', 1, 0) 
```

### **Question 13**: How many devices ran the gpupdate /force command?

[gpupdate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/gpupdate): Updates Group Policy settings.

```sql

| distinct hostname
| count 
```

### **Question 14**: How many machines at Encryptodera ran "systeminfo"?

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline == 'systeminfo'
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

### **Question 15**: What was the timestamp for the first time the command was run?

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline == 'systeminfo'
| project timestamp
| take 1
```

### **Question 16**: How many days elapsed between when the attackers ran discovery commands and when the ransomware attack started?

First we need timestamps of when first enumeration and first exploitation happened, we can get them easily because we already encountered the commands to permform said actions.

**[datetime_diff](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/datetime-diff-function)** function can be used to calculate the delta between timestamps.<br>
**[toscalar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/toscalar-function)** function is used to convert **[dynamic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/dynamic)** type to scalar AKA single value.<br>
**[print](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/print-operator)** operator can be used to show the output.

```sql
let enumeartion = ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline == 'systeminfo'
| project timestamp
| take 1;
let exploitation = ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline == 'gpupdate /force'
| project timestamp
| take 1;
print diffs = datetime_diff('Day', toscalar(exploitation), toscalar(enumeartion))
```

### **Question 17**: What is the hostname of the device where the attackers first ran systeminfo?

Modify query from Question 15.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline == 'systeminfo'
| project hostname
| take 1
```

### **Question 18**: What was the full commandline used by the threat actor when running nltest /dclist?

Given hostname: `41QI-LAPTOP`

The `nltest /dclist:<DomainName>` command is a Windows command-line utility used to display a list of domain controllers in the specified domain. This command is particularly useful for troubleshooting and obtaining information about the domain controllers available in a given Active Directory domain.

- **[nltest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc731935(v=ws.11))**: This is the main command-line utility for managing and troubleshooting aspects of Windows domains.
- `/dclist`: This parameter is used to specify that the command should retrieve a list of domain controllers.
- `<DomainName>`: Replace this with the actual name of the domain for which you want to obtain the list of domain controllers.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == '41QI-LAPTOP'
| where process_commandline has 'nltest /dclist'
| project process_commandline
```

### **Question 19**: What is the full name of the .xlsx.exe file on 41QI-LAPTOP?

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == '41QI-LAPTOP'
| where process_commandline has '.xlsx.exe'
| project process_commandline
```

### **Question 20**: What file shows up a few seconds after the .xlsx.exe file? Enter the filename

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == '41QI-LAPTOP'
| where timestamp > datetime(2024-02-01T08:50:22Z)
| project process_commandline
| take 1
```

> `2024-02-01T08:50:22Z` datetime from Question 19's answer.

### **Question 21**: How many devices does screenconnect_client.exe appear on?

```sql
ProcessEvents 
| where process_commandline has 'screenconnect_client.exe'
| distinct hostname
| count
```

### **Question 22**: Check the Email logs to see if the .xlsx.exe file was sent in a link. What email address was used to send this file?

```sql
Email
| where link has '.xlsx.exe'
| distinct sender
```

### **Question 23**: How many unusual emails were sent by Barry?

1. We need to investigate emails after `2024-02-01` from Barry.
2. As discussed from previous questions attackers hide extension by using double extension. For Windows we are looking for `exe`.
3. Filter for only double extensions. e.g.: '*.docx.exe'

```sql
Email
| where timestamp >= datetime(2024-02-01)
| where link has '.exe'
| where countof(tostring(parse_path(link).Filename), '.') == 2
| count 
```

### **Question 24**: Type got it once you've made a note of these recipients.

### **Question 25**: What IP was used to sign in to Barry's account on February 1st?

```sql
let barryUsername = toscalar(
    Employees
    | where email_addr == 'barry_shmelly@encryptoderafinancial.com'
    | project username
);
AuthenticationEvents
| where monthofyear(timestamp) == 2 // February
| where dayofmonth(timestamp)  == 1 // 1st
| where username == barryUsername;
```

### **Question 26**: How many other accounts did that IP log into?

```sql
AuthenticationEvents
| where src_ip == '143.38.175.105'
```

> Question is about **other accounts** 
{: .prompt-warning }

### **Question 27**: How many IPs logged in to all 8 devices where the attacker ran systeminfo?

I hate how long this question took me to finally realize what it was asking... <!-- It's 2, only 2 ips logged into all 8 devices... -->

```sql
let hosts = ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline has "systeminfo"
| distinct hostname;
AuthenticationEvents
| where hostname in (hosts)
| summarize dcount(hostname) by src_ip

Employees
| where ip_addr == '10.10.0.138'
| project role
```

### **Question 29**: How many successful logins were made from this IP?

```sql
AuthenticationEvents
| where src_ip == '10.10.0.138'
| where result == 'Successful Login'
| count 
```

### **Question 30**: What is the hostname of the server the attackers logged into?

| where username == 'lihenry_domain_admin'
```

### **Question 3**: What is the MITRE ATT&CK ID for Mimikatz?

_**[Mimikatz](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)** is a credential dumper capable of obtaining plaintext Windows account logins and passwords, along with many other features that make it useful for testing the security of networks._

### **Question 4**: Did the threat actor run mimikatz on this device? If so, enter the command line the attacker ran. If not, enter no

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == 'GJ95-LAPTOP'
| where process_commandline has 'mimikatz'
```

### **Question 5**: Who does this device belong to? (Enter the employee's name)

| where hostname == 'GJ95-LAPTOP'
| project email_addr;
Email
| where recipient == toscalar(valerieEmail)
| where sender == 'barry_shmelly@encryptoderafinancial.com'
| project subject, link
```

### **Question 7**: What is the name of the file that was sent to Valerie in the phishing email?

We learned it from Question 6 query.

### **Question 8**: Did Valerie click the link? If so, enter the timestamp when she clicked the link. If not, enter 'no'

```sql
let valerieIP = Employees
| where hostname == 'GJ95-LAPTOP'
| project ip_addr;
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip == toscalar(valerieIP)
| where url has 'Employee_Contact_List_Updated_March_2024.docx.exe'
```

### **Question 9**: How many different user accounts logged into Valerie's machine?

```sql
AuthenticationEvents
| where hostname == 'GJ95-LAPTOP'
| where result == 'Successful Login'
| distinct username
```

### **Question 10**: How many unique hosts did this user account attempt to log into?

```sql
AuthenticationEvents
| where username == 'systadmi_local_admin'
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

### **Question 11**: Which user NOT in an IT role was improperly using the systadmi_local_admin credentials? (This is likely a sign of compromise)

We are directly given an answer query.

```sql
let hosts = FileCreationEvents
| where filename has "screenconnect"
| distinct hostname;
AuthenticationEvents
| where hostname in (hosts)
| where username has "systadmi"
| where result has "Successful"
| join (
    Employees 
    | project ip_addr,role,email_addr,name

```

### **Question 2**: How many bytes of data were sent to that IP on the 5th?

We got information about this question from Question 2.

### **Question 3**: When was data first sent to this IP? (paste the full timestamp)

```sql
NetworkFlow
| where dest_ip == '182.56.23.121' // From Question 1
```

### **Question 4**: On how many distinct days have we sent data to this IP?

Extract only dates using **[format_datetime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/format-datetime-function)** and then count unique values.

```sql
NetworkFlow
| where dest_ip == '182.56.23.121'
| distinct format_datetime(timestamp, 'yyyy-MM-dd')
| count 
```

### **Question 5**: What service is used for the port to which this data is being transferred?

```sql
InboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip == '10.10.0.2'
| where url has 'company'
| where url has 'location'
| project url_decode(url)
```

Crypto Bruh indeed 🤣

### **Question 11**: Who was Jane having a suspicious conversation with? (email address)

```sql
Email
| where sender == 'jane_smith@encryptoderafinancial.com'
```

Privacy101...

![Inside-Encryptodera-1](/assets/images/kc7cyber/InsideEncryptodera/Inside-Encryptodera-1.png)

### **Question 12**: What IP address did the boss man provide to help with smuggling the data?

```

### **Question 14**: What is the name of the crypto theft tool Jane downloads to help with her operation?

We got information about this question from Question 13.

### **Question 15**: To what path does Jane point her data exfiltration tool?

If you filter `ProcessEvents` table for known filenames you will get no results and that's odd. The rogue employee must have used them somehow and we know it jane (username: jasmith).<br>
If you remember Barry he executed encoded payload with powershell, lets look into that.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where  username == 'jasmith'
| where process_commandline has 'powershell.exe'
| project process_commandline
```

```bash
└─$ echo 'Y3J5cHRvX3N0ZWFsZXIuZXhlIC0tZGFpbHkgLS1pbnB1dCBcXFxcTmV0d29ya1NoYXJlXFxjcml0aWNhbF9pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZVxcQ3J5cHRvX1dhbGxldF9TdG9yYWdlX0xvY2F0aW9uc1xcIC0tb3V0cHV0IEM6XFxVc2Vyc1xcamFzbWl0aFxcVG9UaGVNb29uXFw='

crypto_stealer.exe --daily --input \\\\NetworkShare\\critical_infrastructure\\Crypto_Wallet_Storage_Locations\\ --output C:\\Users\\jasmith\\ToTheMoon\\
```

### **Question 16**: At what tempo does she set the tool to run? (one word)

We got information about this question from Question 15.

### **Question 17**: What password does Jane use for the tool?

From Question 15 we can observe a different encoded payload being executed.
