## Description

We found this binary in the backroom, its been marked as "The All Fathers Wisdom" - See hex for further details. Not sure if its just old and hex should be text, or they mean the literal hex.

Anyway can you get this 'wisdom' out of the binary for us?

## Solution 

In Ghidra we see `print_flag`function and buffer of characters: 

```c
  local_8 = 0x75;
  local_10 = 0x26;
  local_18 = 0x31;
  local_20 = 0x22;
  local_28 = 0x25;
  local_30 = 0x31;
  local_38 = 0x77;
  local_40 = 0x24;
  local_48 = 0x31;
  local_50 = 0x25;
  local_58 = 0x26;
  local_60 = 0x31;
  local_68 = 0x21;
  local_70 = 0x22;
  local_78 = 0x31;
  local_80 = 0x74;
  local_88 = 0x25;
  local_90 = 0x31;
  local_98 = 0x75;
  local_a0 = 0x23;
  local_a8 = 0x31;
  local_b0 = 0x22;
  local_b8 = 0x24;
  local_c0 = 0x31;
  local_c8 = 0x20;
  local_d0 = 0x22;
  local_d8 = 0x31;
  local_e0 = 0x77;
  local_e8 = 0x24;
  local_f0 = 0x31;
  local_f8 = 0x74;
  local_100 = 0x27;
  local_108 = 0x31;
  local_110 = 0x20;
  local_118 = 0x22;
  local_120 = 0x31;
  local_128 = 0x25;
  local_130 = 0x27;
  local_138 = 0x31;
  local_140 = 0x77;
  local_148 = 0x25;
  local_150 = 0x31;
  local_158 = 0x73;
  local_160 = 0x26;
  local_168 = 0x31;
  local_170 = 0x27;
  local_178 = 0x25;
  local_180 = 0x31;
  local_188 = 0x25;
  local_190 = 0x24;
  local_198 = 0x31;
  local_1a0 = 0x22;
  local_1a8 = 0x25;
  local_1b0 = 0x31;
  local_1b8 = 0x24;
  local_1c0 = 0x24;
  local_1c8 = 0x31;
  local_1d0 = 0x25;
  local_1d8 = 0x25;
```

`print_flag` - Line 137:<br>
In here each character is getting XOR-ed with 0x11. Statement looks confusing, because it's pseudo code and indexing with pointers (essesnitally iteration happens over buffer but at low level).

```c
charDecoded = *(uint *)(j + i2) ^ 0x11;
```

```
d7 34 f5 47 03 e4 d2 35 13 f5 e6 13 46 f4 b7 64 45 34 55 44
```

The output wasn't making sense, it was't hex so I used [Cipher Identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) and found [Circular Bit Shift](https://www.dcode.fr/circular-bit-shift).
