## Description

POINTS: 400<br>
DIFFICULTY: very easy

Your faction must infiltrate the KORP™ terminal and gain access to the Legionaries' privileged information and find out more about the organizers of the Fray. The terminal login screen is protected by state-of-the-art encryption and security protocols.

## Solution

![korp-terminal-1](/assets/images/htb/2024/cyber_apocalypse/korp-terminal-1.png)

Simple login page. If we try error based SQLi injection we are able to get an error.

```json
{
"error": {
    "message": [
        "1064",
        "1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near ''''' at line 1",
        "42000"
    ],
    "type": "ProgrammingError"
    }
}
```

Simple SQLi payloads didnt work, so I decided to use SQLMap.
* You can get data from Dev Tools or Burpsuite.
* `--ignore-code 401` is required to keep testing, website returns 401 because of failed login.
* `--dbms=MySQL` From error we know that backend is MariaDB (fork of the MySQL)

The admin password is hashed, meaning we have to crack it:

1. Identify hash type (probably 3200)

```bash
└─$ hashcat --show admin.hash
The following 4 hash-modes match the structure of your input hash:

      # | Name                                                       | Category
  ======+============================================================+======================================
   3200 | bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)                               | Operating System
  25600 | bcrypt(md5($pass)) / bcryptmd5                             | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
  25800 | bcrypt(sha1($pass)) / bcryptsha1                           | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
  28400 | bcrypt(sha512($pass)) / bcryptsha512                       | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
```

2. Crack the hash

```bash
