## Description

PixelPerfect | 128 points

Wait, should this file be that large? I thought my phone was perfect?

Downloads: [PixelPerfect.tar.gz](https://ctf.kitctf.de/files/f11ffdb3d28838e1864843dc26f0a4ab/PixelPerfect.tar.gz?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MzksInRlYW1faWQiOjUwNCwiZmlsZV9pZCI6NjN9.ZISQbg.Et51u2XvHLBxWXXqLPKdvWfmahk)

## Analysis

Challenge file is a screenshot image which seems broken. <br> `strings` shows nothing of interest.

But `exiftool` on the other hand shows us a warning
```
Warning                         : [minor] Trailer data after PNG IEND chunk
```

`zsteg` shows more details about trailing chunk.
```sh
└─$ zsteg PXL5_SREENSHOT.png   
[?] 161095 bytes of extra data after image end (IEND), offset = 0x446d9
```

I looked up the value and the image contains 2 `IEND` parts, which shouldn't be there, every PNG file should have single `IEND` to indicate EOF.

Even if we extract the excess data it would be really hard to create proper header, there must be something else...

Lurking around google to find something useful I came across a glaring bold text...
