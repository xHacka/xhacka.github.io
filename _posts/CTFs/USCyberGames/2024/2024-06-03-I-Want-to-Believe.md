## Description

I Want to Believe [Forensics]

We've received a GIFt from what appears to be a signal coming from extraterrestrial life! Although, it appears they've used steganography to hide it inside of this .gif file. All we know is that it's in the form of a text file named 'iwanttobelieve.txt'. Can you recover it?

## Solution

After checking metadata/strings and `binwalk` nothing came up. The description has emphasis on `GIFt`, so there must be a tool which was used. 

After some google searches I found: [https://github.com/dtmsecurity/gift](https://github.com/dtmsecurity/gift)

```bash
└─$ git clone https://github.com/dtmsecurity/gift.git

└─$ py gift/gift-cli.py --source gift.gif recover iwanttobelieve.txt
Recovering files from gift.gif
Recovering iwanttobelieve.txt

└─$ cat iwanttobelieve.txt
