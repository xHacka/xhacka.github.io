## Description

By `Mcsky23`

I fly in the sky, I got wings on my feet.

Downloads: [red.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lnDtdAReV84FWOBimA3WZQmnG2YST5M-/view?usp=drive_link)

## Solution

After downloading the zip, we are unable to extract due to password. 

Since I used 7zip I saw something interesting

Googling `ZipCrypto Store` got me directly to exploits.

I followed this post <https://www.anter.dev/posts/plaintext-attack-zipcrypto/> to get the file from zip.

`script.sh` produces image. `echo '<ReallyLongBase64String> | base64 -d  > red.png`

Since we are most likely dealing with Steganography let's try steganography tools. 

`strings` and `exiftool` came empty handed. Since it's PNG `steghide` or such tools won't work. But what about [zsteg](https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg)?

```bash

0w0 Really long hex string? 

Unfortunately decoding from hex to ascii doesnt give us flag. 

I had encountered similar challenge on [SecurityValley](https://ctftime.org/ctf/865). By similar I mean decoding hex. If it's cryptographically "secured" let's try XOR, in this case XOR with Crib (plaintext) attack.

Since XOR is symetical encryption we need to find key. To find key we try to use Crib Drag attack, where we compare portion of encoded flag to known flag. 

I started cooking in CyberChef:

![mcteenx-4](/assets/images/tfcctf/2023/mcteenx-4.png)

Key = 574c: TF<br>
Key = 5257: CC<br>
Key = 4c52: TF

Full Key: 574c52574c52<br>
XOR  Key: 574c52

Since key got repeated we know for sure that `574c52` is the key.
