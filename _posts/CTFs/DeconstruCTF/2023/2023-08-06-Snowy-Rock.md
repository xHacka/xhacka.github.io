The text in extracted file looks weird, compared to original peom [Snow Day](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46707/snow-day) by Billy Collins.

Hint:

```
//////////////snow/flag/
*Something about friday the ......... :P*
///////////////////
```

After analyzing text nothing was making sense, I thought it was whitespace language but no. Hint wasnt helping. I decided to start looking for tools related to snow, as everything was pointing to it. 

<https://darkside.com.au/snow/>

_**Whitespace steganography**_

_The program SNOW is used to conceal messages in ASCII text by appending whitespace to the end of lines. Because spaces and tabs are generally not visible in text viewers, the message is effectively hidden from casual observers. And if the built-in encryption is used, the message cannot be read even if it is detected._

You can either download the binary or `sudo apt install stegsnow` <https://www.kali.org/tools/stegsnow/>

```bash
└─$ ./snow/snow -C ./snowyrock.txt 
OFTHA62GMFBGUX3FIJYFQZS7ONBGKX3FGM2HS7I=                                                                                                 
```

This is where I fell into the rabbithole. Looks like Base64 right? It's not... The worst part is this tool supports password, so the rabbithole got deeper.

The solution is to decode from Base**32**...
