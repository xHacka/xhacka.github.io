### Description

One of our contributors has created a promo video for BDSec CTF 2023. He sent me a zip file containing the promo video and a readme.txt file. He told me, if I think like a hacker, I'll find something cool! Can you think like a hacker?

### Solution

There's not much hidden in video or txt file, but if you run `strings` and look at the tail:
```
└─$ strings BDSecCTF_2023_Promo.mp4 | tail -16           
|40.<

Some extra quotes and there are some values sandwiched between.<br>
Looks like flag format: `OQFRP{OQFrp_PGS_2023_Ce0z0_I1Q30_sY4T}`

Most likely transposition cipher was applied and let's try the classic [ROT13](https://rot13.com)
