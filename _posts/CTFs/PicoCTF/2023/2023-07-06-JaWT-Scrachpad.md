## Analysis

Our goal is to become admin and see what he has.

* _You will need to log in to access the JaWT scratchpad. You can use any name, other than `admin`... because the `admin` user gets a special scratchpad!_

We also get a hint, JohnTheRipper. To forge new JWT token we need a secret_key and john will be useful in this field.
* _If you don't like your name, use a short and cool one like [John](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper)!_

Our JWT token can be found in cookies. You can use tool like <https://jwt.io> to inspect tokens. Algorithm is HS256 = HMAC-SHA256.

## Solution

```bash
└─$ john --wordlist=$rockyou jwt.token --format=HMAC-SHA256
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (HMAC-SHA256 [password is key, SHA256 256/256 AVX2 8x])
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably

I used same tool to forge new token with known secret key.
