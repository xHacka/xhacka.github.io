## Analysis 

1. Using [dcode cipher identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) we see many possible cipher, but from the title we can guess that it's a French cipher.
2. [VigenÃ¨re_cipher](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#introduction) is most likely the candidate.

 
## Solution

We can decode the text using [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher). The cipher needs a key which we don't know, that's not a problem since Vigenere is known to be a weak cipher. dcode has automatic decryption method.

I used a simple PowerShell commands to grab the result in correct format

```powershell
PS > Select-String -Pattern "YOUCOULDUSE(.*?)ASFLAG" decoded.txt | % { $match= $_.Matches.Groups[1].Value.ToLower(); echo "SecVal{${match}}" }
```

<small>If you don't want to write decoded content into file you could use `-InputObject "DECODED_STR"`</small>
