## Description

Level: 1 Score 5 Category network

There is pcapng file. Can you reveal the authentication credentials?

**Link:** [SecurityValley/PublicCTFChallenges/network/the_shark](https://github.com/SecurityValley/PublicCTFChallenges/tree/master/network/the_shark)

## Observation

We are given file with a small network traffic which can be opened using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

## Solution

Traffic is relatively small, so if we follow the first packet we can learn more about the conversation.
