## Observation
```sh
└─$ chmod u+x crackme-01        

└─$ ./crackme-01                
Sometimes, there is something inside me. Can you get it?

Whoops, that was weird??
```

## Solution

Program says `there is something inside me.` so I tried running `strings` on the file.
```sh
└─$ strings -d -n 6 ./crackme-01
