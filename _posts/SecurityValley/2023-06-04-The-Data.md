## Observation

We are given file with a small network traffic which can be opened using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

## Solution

Traffic shows that `/flag.png` was requested

Wireshark allows us to view the objects from traffic.
`File > Export Objects > HTTP`

You can either `Preview` the image or `Save` and open locally
