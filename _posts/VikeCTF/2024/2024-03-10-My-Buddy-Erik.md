## Description

My buddy Erik wants to play Minecraft so I set up a server for us to play on. I've commited my configuration to GitHub because it's so convenient! Can you make sure that everything is secure?

## Solution

The github [commit history](https://github.com/VikeSec/vikeCTF-2024-minecraft-server/commits/main/) is not that interesting, but we do we a reverted commit: [Revert "Add RCON password"](https://github.com/VikeSec/vikeCTF-2024-minecraft-server/commit/6e429e80e1f7f8924b9b8c9c27295d8b84068480).

Since the commit has been deleted locally and uploaded to remote cloning wont give satisfactory results. We need to search github for deleted commits.

If we go to [branches](https://github.com/VikeSec/vikeCTF-2024-minecraft-server/branches) we see update 2 days ago by [malcolmseyd](https://github.com/malcolmseyd). That's weird... because commit history shows update from last week.
