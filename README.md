# $ who am i

### Hi, I'm WoyAg 👋

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for exploring the ever-evolving digital landscape. This blog is mostly for personal use, where I jot down my thoughts, notes, and findings as I navigate through the complex world of cybersecurity.

You might come across a few errors here and there, but don't worry, that's to be expected! Most of my notes get exported straight from Obsidian, so they're more like raw thoughts and learning experiences. Feel free to browse, comment, or correct anything you find interesting or worth discussing.

Although this is mainly my personal space for organizing my cybersecurity journey, I warmly welcome you to join me. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast, a curious reader, or someone looking to learn, there's always something to explore together.

Thanks for stopping by!

        If you had a question, why WoyAg? Well, it sounds like "voyage" and I think that's pretty fitting. Life, just like learning, is a continuous voyage. Whether we're navigating new cybersecurity challenges, exploring new tools, or just solving everyday problems, every step is a part of that grand journey.

        Each discovery, success, or even failure adds a new chapter to the voyage. In this blog, you'll find fragments of my own journey—sometimes rough, sometimes polished, but always moving forward. Cybersecurity, much like life, requires patience, curiosity, and resilience. And while the destination is important, it's the journey itself that truly matters.

        So here's to all the voyages we take, both online and off!
