# Promptriddle

## Description

This is Level 3
From now on, you can use the 'Audio Player'
Use the 'resources' command to see the files you have access to
Once you know the name of the file, just use the 'open' command to open it

## Solution

```
hacka@Level3:~$ resources
listen.mp3
hacka@Level3:~$ open listen.mp3
Loading audio...
```

The poor bot voice kept repeating one word and that's it for password (sadly).

```bash
hacka@Level3:~$ password [WORD_IN_mp3]
Verifying password...Loading level...
```
