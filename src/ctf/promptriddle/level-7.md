# Level 7

## Description

This is Level 7

## Solution

```bash
hacka@Level7:~$ resources

We are given completly black image and no context. If you ever worked with RGB colors then you must know that colors have large variations and (0,0,0) and (0,0,1) are different colors, but to us humans there's hardly any difference.<br>
For simple color manipulation challenges I like to use this [Online Image Editor](https://www.online-image-editor.com): Open Image -> Color Change -> Equalize.

```bash
hacka@Level7:~$ password [SUBJECT_IN_IMAGE]
