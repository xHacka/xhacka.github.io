# 32 + 32 = 64

## Description

64 is too much, but 32 isn't. 32+32=64?

## Solution

We are given 2 files which seems to contain Base64 encoded data, after decoding we still get Base64. File needs to be Base64 decoded 32 times (hence the name).

```py
from base64 import b64decode as bd

with open('./32_1.txt') as f: data1 = f.read().strip()
with open('./32_2.txt') as f: data2 = f.read().strip()

for i in range(32):
    data1 = bd(data1).decode()
    data2 = bd(data2).decode()

print(f"{data1}{data2}")
```
