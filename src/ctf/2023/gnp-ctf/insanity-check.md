## Description

Read the rules more carefully and you'll find the flag. Just don't loose your sanity along the way...

## Analysis

Let's read rules even more carefully!

In discord there's only text and highly unlikely that there's encryption used. <br>
I visited https://ctf.kitctf.de to maybe find html comments or anything. `Alternative communication channels TBA.` I tried to search for "TBA" with no luck, then I started reading about sponsors (interesting stuff), but still no luck.

## Solution

I was going up and down on website and that's when train passed me by. I looked into images and found the flag!
